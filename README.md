👋 Hi, I’m @AIDude88 
👀 I’m interested in bridging the gap between business analysis and cloud computing, exploring AI, cloud solutions, and security/compliance in cloud environments.
🌱 I’m currently learning Azure fundamentals by experimenting with the Azure portal, documenting my journey through AI and cloud projects, and building a strong foundation for a career as a cloud professional.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on AI-driven projects, Azure-based solutions, and innovative cloud technologies that solve real-world problems.
📫 How to reach me: LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/onyemaifuma/), or via email (mrifumao@gmail.com).
⚡ Fun fact: I transitioned from social services to IT, love playing soccer and tennis, and commute on my Kawasaki Ninja Z1000 SX during Canada’s summer months
